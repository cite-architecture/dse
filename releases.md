# `dse`: release notes

**2.0.1**: Update to `citeobj` library fixes a bug in computing path for some image extensions.

**2.0.0**: API-breaking updates to `scm` and `ohco2` libraries, and implementation of DSE model as a CITE extension.  Most of the API remains unchanged despite the fundamentally different underlying implementation of the abstract model.

**1.0**: Initial release.
