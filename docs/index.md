## The model


Documented scholarly editions relate three entities:

1. a diplomatic transcription of texts
2. a sequence of text-bearing surfaces
3. visual documentary evidence

Passages of text are identified with CTS URNs;  text-bearing surfaces and visual evidence are identified with CITE2 URNs.

See [how to serialize the DSE model to CEX format](cex).


## The code library

`dse` is a cross-platform library written in Scala for working with digital documented scholarly editions.
